# creating-reading-writingdf_objects
Pandas is the most popular python library for Data analysis. The above notebook briefly describes an exercise where DataFrame and Series objects are created both by hand and by reading Data files. Thanks to Kaggles's Pandas microcourse. 
The 'wine reviews' dataset from kaggle is used. Enjoy!
